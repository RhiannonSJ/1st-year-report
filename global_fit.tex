\subsection{GENIE and the comparisons}
GENIE applies theoretical physics models, composed of both physical and unphysical parameters, to detector geometries and materials to build experiment-specific neutrino interaction predictions \cite{genie}. The collaboration is in the process of improving configurations of these models for the purpose of optimising the accuracy of the predictions.

    An archive of experimental data is publicly available, and provides the key ingredient to this configuration update. Comparing the models with these data sets allows for a direct performance evaluation of the predictions, whilst fitting the models to the data enables the parameters to be tuned and consequently improve the prediction.

Summaries of the configuration of the GENIE models are as follows:

    \caption{A brief overview the features which make up the individual model configurations in GENIE. These models will eventually all be tuned.}
    \label{tab:modelConfigs}
\end{figure}


Details on the first model to be tuned (G16\_01b) are as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Includes Empirical MEC
    \item CCQE process is Llewellyn-Smith Model
    \item Dipole Axial Form Factor - Depending on M\(_{A}\) = 0.99 GeV
    \item Nuclear model: Fermi Gas Model - Bodek, Ritchie
\end{itemize}

this model takes the updated default GENIE model (G16\_01a) and additionally addresses the abnormalities seen in recent experiments by incorporating the MEC interaction, described schematically in terms of the theoretical models involved in Figure~\ref{fig:MECSchem} \cite{MEC}.

Datasets currently involved in the fit come from MiniBooNE, T2K and Minerva. An example of a comparison between the MiniBooNE \(\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\) CCQE data set from 2013 and 4 different GENIE predictions is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MBComp}.

The models fit the data with varying accuracies. It can be seen that even the closest fitting model is does not perfectly predict the trend seen in the data, therefore tuning is needed to fully optimise these fits.}
