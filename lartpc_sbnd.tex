\subsection{Booster neutrino beam, BNB}

A Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) of muon neutrinos is formed by firing protons, taken from an accelerator with $\sim$8 GeV kintetic energy, at a beryllium target which produces a hadronic beam consisting mainly of pions. The pions in this beam are then focussed and polarised before they decay, mostly to muon neutrinos, which propagate into the TPC where they interact with the target material. The beam's high muon neutrino excess occurs because the dominant decay channel of pions is ~(\ref{eq:piDecay}) \cite{sbn},

\begin{equation}\label{eq:piDecay}
    \pi ^{ + } \longrightarrow \mu ^{ + } + \nu _{ \mu } 
\end{equation}
    
    and the branching ratio of pions decaying to electrons over muons on the order of $\sim 10 ^{ -4 }$ due to the relation given in equation~(\ref{eq:BR}) \cite{BR}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:BR}
    R_{ \pi } = \left( \dfrac{ m_{ e } }{ m_{ \mu } } \right) ^{2} \left( \dfrac{ m_{ \pi }^{ 2 } - m_{ e } ^{ 2 } }{ m_{ \pi } ^{ 2 } - m_{ \mu } ^{ 2 } } \right) ^{ 2 } \sim 10^{-4}
\end{equation}

The beam fires neutrinos directly into the time projection chamber (TPC) of an experiment at such velocities that it can always be assumed that the particles entered the TPC from one direction and, before iteracting, were forward-going. This technicality gives an immediate criteria for the removal of backgrounds, such as cosmogenic neutrinos, which would enter the TPC from all directions \cite{sbn}.

    
\subsection{Liquid argon time projection chambers, LArTPC}     
    
    In current and future neutrino experiments such as DUNE and the short baseline neutrino (SBN) program (SBND, MicroBooNE and ICARUS), liquid argon is the target material of the detector. Argon in this form is used due to its stability and purity as a noble gas, its high denisty and its low cost. These properties lead to resolution capabilities on the order of the Bubble Chamber experiments, which allows for high certainty in distinguishing between interactions and ultimately optimises the resolving power of the experiment \cite{larRes}. An example event display in liquid argon from the MicroBooNE experiment is given in Figure~\ref{fig:ev_disp} \cite{evDisp}.

Once the neutrino has entered the TPC it interacts with an argon atom to produce final state particles in the detector. These particles may then decay, be asorbed or interact with the argon in the TPC. Ionazation electrons and photons are also produced through these interactions.

A general purpose LArTPC diagram is given in Figure~\ref{fig:lartpc}. A brief description of its functionality is as follows~\cite{lartpc}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Electric field is induced by the potential difference
